# Laboratory Data Science

This repository contains the **Laboratory of Data Science project** developed during my Master's Degree in Data Science & Business Informatics at Univeristy of Pisa.

## Description

The project is divided in three parts.

### Part I
In Part I of the project we create a database using SQL Server Management Studio then we populate it starting from .csv files and perform different operations on it. The ETL phase is accomplished using python scripts.

### Part II
In Part II we solve some problems on the database created in Part I using Sequel Server Integration Services (SSIS) with computation on client side.

### Part III
In Part III we answer some business questions on a datacube created on the database prepared. Then we answer some business questions using MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) in SQL management studio.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf report of the project and different folders which gather the code for the three parts of the project
